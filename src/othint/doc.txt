*** If you are a user then start with reading README.txt instead. ***

This file here is primarly for core developers of otcli 
(how ever it could include some information that you can find interesting too).

=== TEST CASE ===

A: ot nym add alice 
A: ot nym register alice
S: server: will register this nick as aaa12345 for example
B: ot msg sendfrom bob aaa12345
B: ot refresh
S: server: will now store the message
A: ot refresh
A: ot msg ls

=== IDEAS TO DISCUSS ===

Other format - more readable:
B: ot msg send to alice
B: ot msg send to alice from bob amount 51343 asset xgold1 
B: ot msg sendfrom bob alice

=== GIT BRANCH ===

branch pr-xxx - pull request
branch (non-master) - whatever

rfree/master/ - code should be nice and complile (in future)
*/master/ - usually complile, compile when requesting cool

TODO probably replace this with even better solution:
http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq/macros-with-multi-stmts.html
"If you have any problems with your compiler's willingness to inline-expand functions containing loops, you can change MYMACRO()'s definition to if (true) {...} else (void)0"
